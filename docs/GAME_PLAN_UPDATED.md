# 🎮 The Long Nights - Updated Game Direction & Roadmap

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 - Core Survival Systems

---

## 🎯 Game Vision: Survival Defense with Progression

A **survival-focused voxel game** where players must defend against increasingly difficult threats while building, crafting, and exploring.

### Core Pillars:
1. **⚔️ Survival Combat** - Fight to stay alive during blood moon cycles
2. **🏗️ Base Building** - Construct defenses and shelters
3. **📈 Progression** - Unlock better gear, companions, and abilities
4. **🌍 Exploration** - Discover ruins, resources, and secrets

## 🔴 Blood Moon Cycle System

### 7-Day Cycle
- **Days 1-6:** Peaceful exploration, gathering, building
- **Day 7:** Blood Moon - **massive enemy spawns**
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Each cycle gets harder

### Blood Moon Mechanics
- Enemies spawn in waves throughout the night
- Increased enemy count each cycle (Week 1: 10 enemies → Week 10: 100+ enemies)
- Enemies target player base/defenses
- Survive until sunrise to complete the cycle

### Player Preparation
- Days 1-6: Gather resources, craft weapons, build walls
- Strategic base placement near resources but defensible
- Crafting system for better tools, weapons, armor
- Light sources to prevent spawns near base

---

## 🏃 Stamina Rebalance (PRIORITY)

### Current Issues:
- Movement drains stamina too fast
- Resource gathering feels punishing
- Combat becomes stamina-starved quickly

### New Stamina Design:

#### Movement (REDUCED)
- **Walking:** ~0.5-1 stamina/second (down from current)
- **Sprinting:** 5 stamina/second
- **Jumping:** 2 stamina per jump
- Goal: Allow free exploration without constant stamina anxiety

#### Gathering (NEARLY FREE)
- **Basic gathering:** 0-1 stamina per action
  - Picking flowers, berries, mushrooms: FREE
  - Breaking grass, leaves: FREE
  - Mining stone/wood: 1-2 stamina
- **Power tools (later):** 0 stamina (uses tool durability instead)
- Goal: Encourage gathering without tedium

#### Combat (SAME)
- **Sword swing:** 10 stamina
- **Bow shot:** 15 stamina
- **Blocking:** 5 stamina/hit
- Combat should be strategic and resource-intensive

#### Stamina Recovery
- **Standing still:** 20 stamina/second
- **Walking slowly:** 10 stamina/second
- **After combat:** Brief recovery period with boosted regen
- **Food buffs:** Certain foods increase max stamina or regen rate
