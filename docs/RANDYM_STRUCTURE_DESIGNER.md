## 🛠️ Technical Details

### File Locations
```
/src/ui/RandyMStructureDesigner.js  (924 lines)
/src/EnhancedGraphics.js            (Extended with mini texture support)
```

### Integration Points
- **VoxelWorld.js**: Import (line 32), initialization (line 320)
- **Global Function**: `window.openStructureDesigner()` (line ~7185)
- **Help Output**: Added to debug commands (line ~7448 in showCommands())
- **EnhancedGraphics**: New methods `loadMiniTexture()` and `getAvailableBlocks()`
- **ChunkMinis**: Uses pre-generated 32x32 textures from vite plugin

### Memory Management
The designer properly cleans up:
- ✅ All placed block meshes
- ✅ Geometries and materials
- ✅ Preview block
- ✅ Grid and ground plane
- ✅ Renderer and canvas
- ✅ Event listeners
- ✅ Animation frame loop

### Z-Index Architecture
- Modal overlay: `50000`
- Sub-modals (future): `50002`

### Mini Texture System (Phase 2)

**Why ChunkMinis?**
- **Performance**: 32x32 textures vs full-size (512x512+)
- **Fast Loading**: ~2KB per texture vs 100KB+
- **Less RAM**: Perfect for UI elements
- **Pre-Generated**: Vite plugin creates them at build time
- **1:1 Mapping**: Same filenames as `/art/blocks/`

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// EnhancedGraphics.js - New Methods
await enhancedGraphics.loadMiniTexture(blockType, variant);
const blocks = enhancedGraphics.getAvailableBlocks();

// RandyM loads all available blocks
async loadBlockPalette() {
    const blocks = enhancedGraphics.getAvailableBlocks();
    // Create palette items with mini texture thumbnails
}
```

**Asset Path:**
- Full textures: `/art/blocks/*.png` (512x512+)
- Mini textures: `/art/chunkMinis/*.png` (32x32)

---

## 🎮 Game Integration (Future)

### Current Mode: Creative/Debug Mode
RandyM currently operates in **unlimited creative mode** - perfect for:
- 🛠️ **Debug/Testing** - Console access for developers
- 👑 **Admin Mode** - Server administrators and moderators
- 📐 **Blueprint Design** - Create structure templates without limits
- 👁️ **Preview Mode** - Plan before building with real materials

### Planned: NPC-Based Building System

**Vision:**
RandyM will be offered as a service by NPCs in the game world. Players interact with specific NPCs (e.g., "Master Builder") to access the structure designer.

**Inventory Integration:**
```javascript
// Future implementation
class RandyMStructureDesigner {
    constructor(voxelWorld, inventoryMode = false) {
        this.inventoryMode = inventoryMode;
        this.playerInventory = inventoryMode ? voxelWorld.playerInventory : null;
    }
    
    // Check if player has materials
    canPlaceBlock(blockType) {
        if (!this.inventoryMode) return true; // Creative mode
        return this.playerInventory.hasItem(blockType, 1);
    }
    
    // Deduct materials on placement
    placeBlock() {
        if (this.inventoryMode) {
            if (!this.playerInventory.removeItem(this.selectedBlockType, 1)) {
                this.showInsufficientMaterialsWarning();
                return;
            }
        }
        // ... place block logic
    }
    
    // Refund materials on undo/delete
    removeBlock(x, y, z) {
        const block = this.placedBlocks.get(key);
        if (this.inventoryMode && block) {
            this.playerInventory.addItem(block.blockType, 1);
        }
        // ... remove block logic
    }
}
```

**UI Changes for Inventory Mode:**
- Material counts shown in block palette (e.g., "Oak Wood x64")
- Grayed out/disabled blocks when insufficient materials
- Real-time material counter updates
- "Insufficient Materials" warning popup
- Cost preview tooltip on hover
- Material refund on undo/delete operations

**NPC Integration Points:**
```javascript
// Example NPC interaction
class MasterBuilderNPC extends NPC {
    onInteract(player) {
        if (player.hasCompletedQuest('builder_license')) {
            // Open RandyM with inventory mode
            const randyM = new RandyMStructureDesigner(
                this.voxelWorld, 
                true // Enable inventory mode
            );
            randyM.open();
        } else {
            this.showDialogue("Complete my quest first!");
        }
    }
}
```

**Planned NPC Types:**
- 🏗️ **Master Builder** - General structures, teaches basics
- 🏰 **Castle Architect** - Large fortifications, advanced shapes
- 🌳 **Garden Designer** - Decorative structures, natural builds
- ⚒️ **Engineer** - Functional structures, mechanisms

**Additional Features:**
- 💾 **Save as Blueprint** - Export structure to inventory item
- 📜 **Blueprint Library** - Share designs between players
- 💰 **Service Fee** - NPC charges coins/items for access
- 🎓 **Tutorials** - NPCs teach building techniques
- 🏆 **Achievements** - Rewards for complex structures

**Benefits:**
- Adds value to gathered materials
- Encourages resource management
- Creates interesting NPC interactions
- Monetization of building skill
- Social sharing of blueprints

## 🛠️ Shape Tools Guide (Phase 5.6)

### Tool Modes

1. **🖌️ Place** (Default)
   - Single block placement
   - Left click to place one block at a time
   - Best for detailed work

2. **🧊 Fill Cube**
   - Creates solid rectangular volumes
   - Click first corner, then second corner
   - Fills entire volume with selected block
   - Great for making large walls or foundations

3. **📦 Hollow Cube**
   - Creates rectangular shells
   - Click first corner, then second corner
   - Only places blocks on outer surfaces
   - Perfect for making rooms or structures

4. **🧱 Wall**
   - Creates vertical planes
   - Click first point, then second point
   - Auto-detects best orientation (XY or ZY plane)
   - Ideal for building walls quickly

5. **⬛ Floor**
   - Creates horizontal planes
   - Click first corner, then diagonal corner
   - Uses Y coordinate from first click
   - Great for floors, ceilings, platforms

6. **📏 Line**
   - Creates straight lines in 3D space
   - Click start point, then end point
   - Uses 3D Bresenham algorithm for smooth lines
   - Useful for beams, railings, details

### Using Shape Tools

1. **Select Tool**: Click tool mode in right palette (green highlight = active)
2. **Choose Block**: Select block type from left palette
3. **First Click**: Click to set start point (console shows coordinates)
4. **Move Mouse (XZ)**: See semi-transparent preview, move to define horizontal dimensions (e.g., 5x3 rectangle)
5. **Hold Shift (Y)**: System "freezes" the X/Z dimensions you defined, adjust vertical height by moving mouse up/down
   - Blue indicator shows current height offset (+5 blocks, etc.)
   - Preview updates in real-time showing full 3D shape
   - X/Z dimensions stay locked at the moment you pressed Shift (no distortion!)
   - 20 pixels of mouse movement = 1 block height
6. **Second Click**: Click to place entire shape (Shift+Click if adjusting height)
7. **Undo**: Press Ctrl+Z to undo entire shape at once
8. **Cancel**: Press ESC to cancel and start over

### Pro Tips

- **Vertical Building Made Easy**: Click ground point, hold Shift, move mouse up to build tall structures in one action!
- **No Support Needed**: You can now build hollow shapes high in the air without stacking layer-by-layer
- **Preview is Real-Time**: Shape updates as you move mouse (both XZ and Y dimensions)
- **Batch Undo**: Entire shape undoes as one action (not block-by-block)
- **ESC Anytime**: Cancel shape selection without penalty
- **Mix Tools**: Switch between tools mid-workflow
- **Combine Shapes**: Use Fill Cube + Hollow Cube for complex structures
- **Delete Blocks**: Right-click any block to delete (no door tool needed!)
