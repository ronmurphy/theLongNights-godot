## 🎮 How to Use the Farming System

### 1. Get the Hoe
- **Craft at ToolBench:** 2 wood + 1 stick = hoe
- **Or debug:** `giveItem('hoe')`

### 2. Equip the Hoe ⚡ **NEW!**
- Place hoe in **player bar** (right sidebar equipment slots)
- Like machete, it becomes "always active"
- No need to select it in hotbar!

### 3. Till Soil (Instant Action!)
- Hoe must be in **equipment slot** (player bar)
- Look at grass or dirt blocks
- **Quick left-click** = instant till (no harvest timer!)
- **Hold left-click** = harvest block (breaks it)
- Block converts to tilled_soil
- ⚠️ Must have air above block to till

### 4. Plant Seeds
- Equip seeds in hotbar
- Right-click on tilled_soil
- Seeds are consumed, crop stage 1 appears

### 5. Growth System
- Crops grow automatically based on in-game day cycle
- Growth rates:
  - **Wheat/Carrot:** 30 days total (3 stages × 10 days)
  - **Pumpkin:** 45 days total (3 stages × 15 days)  
  - **Berry Bush:** 36 days total (3 stages × 12 days)
- Watered crops grow 2x faster (feature ready, needs water bucket item)

### 6. Harvest
- Wait for crops to reach stage 3 (fully grown)
- Left-click (harvest) the mature crop
- Receive crop items + seeds for replanting
- Watered crops yield 2x items

## 🔮 Technical Details

### Block Types Added (14 total)
```javascript
// Tilled soil
tilled_soil

// Wheat growth stages
wheat_stage1, wheat_stage2, wheat_stage3

// Carrot growth stages  
carrot_stage1, carrot_stage2, carrot_stage3

// Pumpkin growth stages
pumpkin_stage1, pumpkin_stage2, pumpkin_stage3

// Berry bush growth stages
berry_bush_stage1, berry_bush_stage2, berry_bush_stage3
```

### Item Types Added (9 total)
```javascript
// Tools
hoe

// Seeds
wheat_seeds, carrot_seeds, pumpkin_seeds, berry_seeds

// Harvested crops
wheat, carrot, berry, corn_ear, rice
```

### Day/Night Cycle Integration
- Added `currentDay` counter to track total days passed
- Increments when day wraps around midnight
- CropGrowthManager checks day changes to progress crop growth
- Tilled soil timer uses day count for reversion

### Save/Load Support
- CropGrowthManager tracks all planted crops
- Saves crop position, type, stage, planted day, watered status
- Tracks tilled soil locations and tilled day
- Serialization/deserialization methods ready for integration

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Harvest grass to get wheat_seeds and carrot_seeds
- [ ] Harvest pumpkins to get pumpkin_seeds
- [ ] Find and harvest shrubs to get berry_seeds
- [ ] Craft hoe at ToolBench (2 wood + 1 stick)
- [ ] Right-click grass/dirt with hoe to till soil
- [ ] Right-click tilled soil with seeds to plant
- [ ] Wait for crops to grow through 3 stages
- [ ] Harvest mature crops to get items + seeds

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Tilled soil reverts to dirt after 24 in-game days (no plant)
- [ ] Cannot till blocks with something above them
- [ ] Cannot plant seeds on non-tilled blocks
- [ ] Shrubs spawn without trees on top
- [ ] Seed icons display correctly in inventory
- [ ] Hoe doesn't place as a block (tool only)

### Performance
- [ ] Crop growth doesn't cause lag
- [ ] Multiple crops can grow simultaneously
- [ ] Day counter increments correctly
- [ ] Save/load preserves crop data

## 🚀 Next Features (Phase 2)

### Water Bucket Item
- Craft from iron blocks
- Right-click crops to water
- Visual indicator (darker soil)
- Enables 2x growth speed bonus

### Advanced Features
- Scarecrows to protect crops
- Fertilizer system (compost)
- Crop quality tiers (Perfect/Good/Normal)
- Greenhouse structures
- Sprinkler irrigation systems

### Animal Farming (Phase 3)
- Chickens (eggs)
- Cows (milk)
- Sheep (wool)
- Barns & Coops

### Cooking System (Phase 4)
- Cooking station
- Food recipes
- Meal buffs (speed, jump, mining, health)

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **No water bucket yet** - Watering system is coded but needs water bucket item
2. **No visual soil wetness** - Watered state tracked internally but no texture change
3. **No crop textures** - Using procedurally generated textures (can add PNGs later)
4. **No tilled soil texture** - Using tilled_soil-all.png (already exists)
