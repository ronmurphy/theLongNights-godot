# Tutorial System - Final Fix Summary
**Date:** October 14, 2025

## Problems Found

### 1. Duplicate Initialization Messages
```
🎓 TutorialScriptSystem initialized
🎓 CompanionTutorialSystem initialized  ← Wrong message!
```
- The Long Nights.js had the wrong console.log message even though it was using TutorialScriptSystem

### 2. Data Loading Path Issues
```
/data/tutorialScripts.json:1  Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
```
- Tutorial JSON was trying to load from `/data/` but file wasn't accessible
- Initial solution was too complex (custom Vite plugin)

## The Simple Solution ✅

### Moved Data Folder into Assets
```bash
mv data assets/data
```

**Why this works:**
- Vite's `publicDir: 'assets'` copies EVERYTHING from `assets/` to `dist/`
- `assets/data/` → `dist/data/` automatically
- Same system already working for `/assets/art/`, `/assets/music/`, etc.
- No custom plugins needed!

### File Structure Now:
```
assets/
├── art/
├── data/               ← NEW location
│   ├── blueprints.json
│   ├── plans.json
│   ├── recipes.json
│   └── tutorialScripts.json
├── help/
├── music/
└── ...
```

### Loading Path:
```javascript
// TutorialScriptSystem.js
fetch('/data/tutorialScripts.json')  // Works in both dev and production!
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Console Message
**File:** `/src/The Long Nights.js` line 307
```javascript
// OLD:
console.log('🎓 CompanionTutorialSystem initialized');

// NEW:
console.log('🎓 TutorialScriptSystem initialized');
```

### 2. Moved Data Folder
**Command:**
```bash
mv data assets/data
```

### 3. Updated Load Path
**File:** `/src/ui/TutorialScriptSystem.js`
```javascript
// Path stays the same - just works now!
fetch('/data/tutorialScripts.json')
```

### 4. Cleaned Up vite.config.js
**File:** `/vite.config.js`
- Removed unnecessary `copyDataFiles` plugin
- Added comment explaining that data is now in assets

### 5. Can Delete (No Longer Needed)
- `/vite-plugin-copy-data.js` - Custom plugin not needed anymore

## Expected Output

### Build:
```
✓ 128 modules transformed.
dist/data/tutorialScripts.json ← Automatically copied!
```

### Runtime:
```
🎓 TutorialScriptSystem initialized
🎓 Loaded 15 tutorial scripts
```

## How It Works

### Development (`npm run dev`):
1. Vite dev server serves from `assets/data/tutorialScripts.json`
2. URL `/data/tutorialScripts.json` resolves correctly

### Production (`npm run build`):
1. Vite copies `assets/` → `dist/`
2. `assets/data/` becomes `dist/data/`
3. Electron serves from `dist/`
4. URL `/data/tutorialScripts.json` resolves correctly

### Both modes work because:
- Vite's publicDir handles the path mapping
- The loading code doesn't need to know the difference

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] `dist/data/tutorialScripts.json` exists
- [x] Only ONE initialization message shows
- [ ] Console shows: `🎓 Loaded 15 tutorial scripts`
- [ ] No more "Failed to fetch" errors
- [ ] Tutorials trigger correctly in-game

**Result**: Simple, clean solution that leverages existing Vite publicDir system! 🎯
