# ✅ Rollback Complete - Ready to Rebuild

## What Was Rolled Back

### EnhancedGraphics.js
- ❌ REMOVED: Electron path detection (`dist/art` vs `art`)
- ✅ RESTORED: Original paths (`art/blocks`, `art/tools`, etc.)

### The Long Nights.js  
- ❌ REMOVED: Electron music path detection
- ✅ RESTORED: Original path (`/music/forestDay.ogg`)

## Why The Change Broke Things

The `dist/` structure after Vite build:
```
dist/
├── art/          ← At root level
├── assets/       ← Vite bundles (JS/CSS)
├── fonts/
├── music/
└── index.html
```

When electron loads `file:///path/to/dist/index.html`:
- ✅ Relative path `art/blocks/oak.jpeg` works (looks in `dist/art/blocks/oak.jpeg`)
- ❌ Absolute path `dist/art/blocks/oak.jpeg` fails (looks for `file:///dist/art/...`)

## What Actually Works

The ORIGINAL code was correct! The paths `art/blocks`, `music/`, etc. work fine because:
1. Vite copies `assets/` → `dist/` at root level
2. Electron loads `dist/index.html`
3. Relative paths resolve correctly

## Current Status

✅ **Code is back to working state**  
✅ **Tree textures should work again**  
✅ **Just needs rebuild**

## Action

```bash
./desktopBuild.sh
```

After rebuild, tree textures should work again! 🌲

## Remaining Issues (Separate Fixes Needed)

### 1. Entity/Tool Images - 404 Errors
**These were ALSO broken before my change**, so they need a different fix.

**Problem**: Console shows:
```
✅ entities: 88 assets found
❌ art/entities/goblin.png: 404
```

**Likely Cause**: These files aren't being loaded correctly even with the preload API. Need to investigate why entity images specifically fail while block textures work.

### 2. Music Files
**Problem**: `/music/forestDay.ogg` 404

**Check**: Is `music/` folder actually in `dist/` after build? (We saw it in the ls output, so should work)

### 3. Emoji Files
**Problem**: `/node_modules/emoji-datasource-google/...` 404

**Cause**: These aren't in `dist/`, they're unpacked but in a different location

**Fix Needed**: Either copy to `dist/node_modules/` or use custom protocol handler

## Next Steps After Rebuild

1. Rebuild: `./desktopBuild.sh`
2. Test - trees should work
3. Check console for remaining 404s
4. Debug entities/music separately (probably different root causes)
