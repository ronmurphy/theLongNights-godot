# 🎮 GPU Selection Feature - Quick Start Guide

## What's New?

The Long Nights now has **in-game GPU selection**! You can switch between your dedicated GPU (for maximum performance) and integrated GPU (for battery saving) directly from the menu.

## Default Behavior

**The game defaults to Low-Power mode for broad compatibility.**

This means:
- ✅ Works great on laptops with only iGPU
- ✅ Saves battery on systems with dGPU (until you change it)
- ✅ Smooth experience for casual users who don't tweak settings
- ✅ Power users with dGPU can easily switch to High Performance

### Why Low-Power Default?

**Philosophy:** *"Casual users just want it to work. Power users will tinker anyway."*

- **iGPU-only users** get optimal performance immediately
- **dGPU users** will explore settings and find High Performance mode
- **Everyone** gets a smooth first impression

## How to Use

### 1. Open the Menu
- Press **ESC** key, or
- Click the **time/day indicator** in the top-right corner

### 2. Find the GPU Section
At the top of the menu, you'll see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│      Current GPU:           │
│    RTX 4060 Mobile          │  ← Shows detected GPU
│                             │
│ ⚡ High Performance (dGPU)   │  ← Click to cycle
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Select Your Preference

Click the GPU button to cycle through 3 options:

| Mode | Icon | Description | Best For |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Low Power** (Default) | 🔋 | Uses integrated GPU | iGPU systems, battery saving |
| **High Performance** | ⚡ | Uses dedicated GPU | Gaming, plugged in, dGPU systems |
| **Auto** | 🎯 | Browser chooses | General use |

### 4. Apply Changes

1. **Select your preferred mode** (button changes with each click)
2. **Reload the page** - Press `F5` or `Ctrl+R` (Windows) / `Cmd+R` (Mac)
3. **Re-run benchmark** - Open menu → Click "⚡ Re-run Benchmark"
4. **Enjoy optimized performance!**

| 🔋 Low Power (Default) | Radeon 780M | 2-3 | 30-45 | Low 🔋 |
| ⚡ High Performance | RTX 4060 | 4 | 60+ | High ⚡⚡⚡ |
| 🎯 Auto | Varies | 2-4 | 30-60 | Medium |

## Troubleshooting

### GPU not changing after reload?
1. Make sure you pressed **F5** to reload
2. Check browser console (F12) for GPU info
3. Try Windows Graphics Settings (see full guide)

### Menu shows "Unknown GPU"?
- Your browser may have GPU detection disabled
- The GPU selection will still work
- Check console with F12 for technical details

### Still getting low performance?
1. Make sure laptop is **plugged in** (not on battery)
2. Select **High Performance** mode
3. **Reload page** (F5)
4. Click **"Re-run Benchmark"** in menu
5. Check Windows Power Plan is "High Performance"

## Advanced: Console Verification

Open browser console (F12) and look for:

```javascript
🎮 GPU INFO: {
  vendor: "NVIDIA Corporation",
  renderer: "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU",
  preference: "high-performance"
}
```

- **vendor**: Who made the GPU
- **renderer**: Specific GPU model
- **preference**: Current setting (high-performance/low-power/default)

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to reload the page every time?**  
A: Yes, GPU changes require a page reload. WebGL contexts can't switch GPUs on the fly.

**Q: What if I only have one GPU?**  
A: The menu will still work! If you only have integrated graphics, all modes use the same GPU. If you only have dedicated graphics, you're already using the best option.

**Q: Does this work on desktop computers?**  
A: Yes! Though desktop usually have one GPU, this feature still lets you control power preferences.

**Q: Can I set different GPUs for different websites?**  
A: Yes! Each website remembers its own GPU preference via localStorage.

**Q: Will my choice be saved?**  
A: Yes! Your GPU preference is saved and will be remembered next time you launch the game.

## Related Settings

- **Render Distance**: Adjusted after GPU change via benchmark
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Works with any GPU (may affect performance)
