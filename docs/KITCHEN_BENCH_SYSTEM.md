## 📊 Buff Balance

### **Design Goals**
1. **Stamina Loop** - Food completes farm → cook → eat → explore cycle
2. **Exploration Aid** - Buffs help reach distant biomes
3. **Strategic Choice** - Different foods for different situations
4. **Progression Curve** - Simple foods → complex buffs

### **Balance Tweaks** (if needed)
```javascript
// In KitchenBenchSystem.js, adjust buff values:

pumpkin_pie: {
    buffs: {
        stamina: 120,              // ← Increase/decrease
        staminaDrainReduction: 0.4, // ← 0.0-1.0 (0% to 100% reduction)
        speedBoost: 1.2,           // ← 1.0+ (1.5 = 50% faster)
        duration: 240              // ← seconds
    }
}
```
